get it? because you *blend* puree?

# Installation
I use [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) for this, you can use whatever works for you

Download [blender.user.js](https://github.com/ducky4life/ns-blender/raw/refs/heads/main/blender.user.js) (or paste it in your script runner), enter your main nation, run it, enjoy

If you use TamperMonkey, go to the blender.user.js link above and TamperMonkey should pop up automatically with the [Latest Release](https://github.com/ducky4life/ns-blender/releases/latest)

# Configuration

The script works on https://esfalsa.github.io/puree automatically, press 's' to start the script on the list generator (https://esfalsa.github.io/puree/list)

## Link Mode

Link mode replaces regions in the list with the red links of the regions. If you turn this off, the regions will be replaced with '(raider owned)' in red text instead.

Turning this on gives more information, but is more distracting.

Please set your default mode on the `const linkMode = ` line!

You can toggle between the modes by pressing 'a'
